# 📰 Article Page  

A simple, clean **Article Page** built using only **HTML**.  

## 📖 Project Description  
This project was created as a **practice exercise** to strengthen my skills in **HTML structure and formatting**.  
The page represents a sample article layout with a title, author/date, image, and content paragraphs.  

The main purpose of this project is to:  
- Practice writing semantic HTML code  
- Understand how to organize text content into sections  
- Get familiar with structuring an article layout similar to blogs or news sites
